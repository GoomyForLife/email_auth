# ** Currently on Maintanence, No worries the package will work fine, We are updating to match the user requests üò∏üöÄ

# Email verification for Flutter Apps using DART.

##### Key points :
  - This package allows developers to verify that the provided Email is valid and also an existing one,
  - We confirmit by sending an OTP to the specified email ID and verify them.

## Features!
  - It has Email ID by default, just call the function and voila... 
  - **Verifying an email** again call a function and that's it.. 

## Next Plans
  - Making the availablity of custom Email Ids.
  - Supporting different formats.

## Usage
```dart
import 'package:email_auth/email_auth.dart';
...
Inside your stateLess / Statefull widget class
  ...
  final TextEditingController _emailController = TextEditingController();
  final TextEditingController _otpController = TextEditingController();
  ///create a method to send the Emails
  void sendOtp()async{
    ///Accessing the EmailAuth class from the package
       EmailAuth.sessionName = "Sample";
    ///a boolean value will be returned if the OTP is sent successfully
    var data =
        await EmailAuth.sendOtp(receiverMail: _emailController.value.text);
    if(!data){
        ///have your error handling logic here, like a snackbar or popup widget
    }
  }
  ///create a bool method to validate if the OTP is true
  bool verify(){
    return(EmailAuth.validate(
        receiverMail: _emailController.value.text, //to make sure the email ID is not changed
        userOTP: _otpController.value.text)); //pass in the OTP typed in
    ///This will return you a bool, and you can proceed further after that, add a fail case and a success case (result will be true/false)
  }
  ...
   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
   /// have your controllers assigned to textFields or textFormFields
   ...
    body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            TextField(
              controller: _emailController,
            ),
            TextField(
              controller: _otpController,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      ...
```
